    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Porotos granados is a traditional Chilean countryside stew made mainly 
        of ripe Cranberry beans,[1] maize kernels and squash. 
        Other common ingredients are onions, and herbs such as cumin, basil 
        and oregano. Pumpkin is also used in some recipes. 
        It is considered a summer stew, because that is when the maize and 
        summer squash are harvested in central and southern Chile.

    <h2>Recipe :P</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped into squares</li>
        <li>1 clove of minced garlic</li>
        <li>Salt, paprika, pepper, and cumin to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 kg (3.3 lb) of cranberry beans</li>
        <li>2 corns</li>
        <li>1/4 kg (about 1/2 lb) of pumpkin (or squash)</li>
        <li>8 basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Thrash the beans (i.e. remove them from their husks), chop the corns, wash and chop the pumpkin into medium-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, cook with enough hot water to cover the beans and chopped pumpkin, add a little salt and about 4 basil leaves. Cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile make a stir-fry sauce in a pan with oil, onion chopped in squares, garlic, chopped basil, and the remaining spices. It takes about 7 minutes, more or less.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile add the corn to the mixture of beans, and cook for about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the stir-fry sauce that was prepared, stir well and cook for about 3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Let it stand and serve with basil on top or with “color”, which is basically red pepper powder with some lard or melted butter.</li>
        <li>ENJOY!! :P</li>
