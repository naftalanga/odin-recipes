    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Charquicán is a stew dish that is popular in Chile, Peru, 
        Bolivia and other countries in the Andean region, such as the Cuyo 
        region of Argentina. 
        A similar dish eaten in Northwest Argentina is called Charquisillo, 
        a dish made with ch’arki and rice.
        Charquicán is made with ch'arki or beef, potatoes, pumpkin, 
        white corn, onion and sometimes peas and corn. 
        It was originally made from dried and salted llama meat or beef. 
        The modern Chilean version of Charquicán is made with minced 
        beef and topped with a fried egg.
